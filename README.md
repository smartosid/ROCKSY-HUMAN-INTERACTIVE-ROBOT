# ROCKSY-HUMAN-INTERACTIVE-ROBOT

ROCKSY, a smart surveillance robot powered by a Raspberry
Pi. ROCKSY integrates multiple technologies—computer vision, speech-based AI, web
scraping, and IoT device management—into a single, compact platform. Unlike traditional
systems dependent on cloud infrastructure, ROCKSY leverages edge computing to ensure
mobility, privacy, and real-time responsiveness.
ROCKSY bridges critical gaps in conventional home security solutions through features such as
autonomous navigation, human posture recognition, and an intuitive voice interface. It functions
not only as a security monitor but also as a real-time assistant capable of controlling smart
devices, retrieving useful information, and responding promptly to emergencies. As the concept
of smart living continues to progress, context-aware and interactive robots are becoming
essential components of future homes. ROCKSY exemplifies how powerful, edge-based AI
solutions can be made accessible and practical, shaping the future of home automation and
digital companionship.
